# Tasbih (Prayer Beads)
The Tasbih feature functions as a digital counter, simulating the use of traditional prayer beads. By including this feature in the app, users can engage in a rewarding act while using their phones.


# Adkar (Remembrances)
This section provides daily reminders of adkar (remembrances) of Allah (SWT). It is highly beneficial for Muslims to recite these adkar every day. Clicking on each button reveals a list of adkar, and if a dikr (remembrance) needs to be repeated multiple times, the corresponding number is indicated in a square below the dikr. The square can also function as a Tasbih counter to help users keep track of their count. Each dikr is supported by authentic narrations from the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
